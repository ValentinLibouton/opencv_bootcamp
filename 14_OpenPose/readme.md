## Quiz
1. Which OpenCV function is used for drawing the pose estimation results on an image?
- [ ] `cv2.rectangle()`
- [ ] `cv2.putText()`
- [x] `cv2.line()`
- [ ] `cv2.drawContours()`

2. Why is it important to convert an image to a blob before feeding it to a pose estimation model?
- [ ] It reduces the size of the image and makes it faster to process
- [x] It standardizes the image format and ensures compatibility with the model
- [ ] It makes the image easier to visualize and interpret
- [ ] It allows the model to adjust its parameters based on the specific image being processed.

3. The applications of Caffe Model for pose estimation is/are:
- [ ] Human action recognition and behavior analysis
- [ ] Facial recognition and emotion detection
- [ ] Autonomous driving and robotics
- [x] All of the above

4. Which of the following is a challenge in using the Caffe Model for pose estimation?
- [ ] The model is not able to detect poses in videos
- [ ] The model is not able to detect poses in real-time
- [x] The model is sensitive to variations in lighting and background.
- [ ] The model is not accurate for images containing multiple people.
