- [ ] `cv2.LINE_AA,`
- [ ] `cv2.LINE_8`
- [ ] `cv2.LINE_4`
- [x] `cv2.LINE_16`

2. The purpose of the pt1 and pt2 parameters in `cv2.rectangle` is:
- [x] To specify the coordinates of the top-left and bottom-right corners of the rectangle
- [ ] To specify the center and radius of the rectangle

- [ ] To specify the angle and size of the rectangle 

3. What happens if the specified font size in `cv2.putText()` is negative?
- [x] The text will be drawn upside down
- [ ] The text will not be displayed
- [ ] The function will return an error
- [ ] The text size will be proportional to the image size

4. What is an innovative use of `cv2.circle()` in OpenCV?
- [ ] Drawing circular objects in images
- [ ] Creating Venn diagrams
- [ ] Highlighting regions of interest in an image
- [x] All of the above 

5. When the thickness parameter is set to a negative value in `cv2.rectangle`, then:
- [x] The rectangle is filled with color instead of being outlined
- [ ] The rectangle is not drawn
- [ ] An error is thrown
- [ ] The thickness is set to the absolute value of the negative value
